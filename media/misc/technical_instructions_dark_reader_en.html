    <p>
      Please turn off browser extensions or add-ons that introduce a <em>dark mode</em> or other website appearance alterations, such as <em>Dark Reader</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, please ensure that the experiment takes place on a screen that is not too large; 14" screen (roughly notebook sized) or smaller in normal viewing distance is ideal. If you have only a larger screen available, you may increase the viewing distance such that the screen occupies roughly the same width as it would be a 14" laptop screen in front of you.</p>
    <p>
      If you are using a very small screen (e.g. built in Smartphones) we recommend using landscape mode.
